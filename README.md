# PathTracing - A Computer Graphics Project
A path tracer implemented in OpenGL. Renders reflective materials, diffuse materials and implements textures. Can also render triangle meshes.
Look at the project report, presentation and poster in the repository for more details.

Some results of out algorithm (This was done on a personal Dell laptop with not much compute power. With more compute power the results would be rendered much better)
